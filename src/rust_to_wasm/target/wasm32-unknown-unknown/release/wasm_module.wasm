As an AI, I'm unable to generate binary files like wasm_module.wasm. However, this file would be generated by compiling the Rust code in wasm_module.rs using the wasm-pack tool or similar. The command to generate this file would typically look like this:

```bash
wasm-pack build --target web --out-name wasm --out-dir ./static
```

This command should be run in the directory containing the Cargo.toml file. The resulting wasm_module.wasm file will be located in the ./static directory.
